## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Processes receipts via `POST /receipts/process`
- Retrieves earned points via `GET /receipts/{id}/points`
- In-memory storage (no database needed)
- Follows exact rules as specified in the prompt
- Thread-safe (uses mutex for concurrency)
- Clean project structure: `handlers`, `models`, `utils`, `store`

## ðŸ§  Rules Used for Scoring

* +1 point per alphanumeric character in the retailer name
* +50 points if total is a whole dollar
* +25 points if total is a multiple of 0.25
* +5 points for every 2 items
* +\[ceil(price Ã— 0.2)] for item descriptions with length divisible by 3
* +6 points if purchase day is odd
* +10 points if time is between 2:00pm and 4:00pm

ðŸ“Š The terminal will also log a full breakdown of how points were calculated.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Test Data

Test receipts are available in the `testdata/` directory:

* `mnm.json`
* `morning-receipt.json`
* `simple-receipt.json`
* `target.json`
